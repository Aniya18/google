      <p> Pinch me I’m dreaming! I still can’t believe I, at 16, was able to represent
        Zume Inc. at Googleplex-Google’s headquarters- for the Small Business Meetup.
        I had high expectations of what Google would be like considering I watched
        The Internship on the plane ride to California; yet, google still managed to
        exceeded all of my expectations. </p>
      <p> At this three-day event, I along with 49 other businesses from across
         the country attended various sessions where we learned how Google could
         help with growing a business. In these sessions I learned about improving
         a customer’s mobile experience, understanding Google analytics, and other
         platforms Google has to support businesses. </p>
      <p> While Google taught me a lot, I also learned from other business owners
        as well. I was intrigued by their stories of an idea that became a mission,
        and a mission that became a business. After these three days, I became even
         more inspired and excited about starting my own business. I will surely be
         signing yearbooks: </p>
